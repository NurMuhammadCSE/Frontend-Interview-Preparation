Sets the stage for the interview questions:

1. What is event-driven programming in Node.js, and how does it work?

Answer: Node.js is built on an event-driven architecture. It uses the EventEmitter class to handle events and callbacks. Here’s a simple example:

const EventEmitter = require('events');

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

// Event listener
emitter.on('myEvent', (data) => {
console.log(Event received with data: ${data});
});

// Emitting the event
emitter.emit('myEvent', 'Hello, World!');

2. Explain the difference between “require” and “import” in Node.js.

Answer: require is used for CommonJS modules, while import is used for ES6 modules. Node.js has added support for ES6 modules, but you can use either based on your project setup.

3. What is middleware in Express.js, and why is it important?

Answer: Middleware in Express.js are functions that have access to the request and response objects. They can perform tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling. Here’s an example:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware function
app.use((req, res, next) => {
console.log('Middleware function');
next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000);

4. Explain callback hell (Callback Pyramid) and how to avoid it.

Answer: Callback hell occurs when you have multiple nested callbacks. You can avoid it by using Promises, async/await, or libraries like async.js or Promise.all. Here's an example using async/await:

async function fetchData() {
try {
const data1 = await getDataFromAPI1();
const data2 = await getDataFromAPI2(data1);
const data3 = await getDataFromAPI3(data2);
// ...
} catch (error) {
console.error(error);
}
}

5. What is a closure in JavaScript, and how is it relevant in Node.js?

Answer: A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, outer function’s scope, and the global scope. Closures are important in Node.js for maintaining state and encapsulation. Here’s an example:

function outerFunction() {
const outerVar = 'I am from outer function';

function innerFunction() {
console.log(outerVar);
}

return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure(); // Prints "I am from outer function"

6. What is the purpose of the package.json file in Node.js projects?

Answer: package.json is used to manage project dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It's crucial for package management and script execution. Here's an example:

{
"name": "my-node-app",
"version": "1.0.0",
"dependencies": {
"express": "^4.17.1"
},
"scripts": {
"start": "node app.js"
}
}

7. How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations, and what is the Event Loop?

Answer: Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous operations. The Event Loop is at the core of this model, managing callbacks efficiently. Here’s a simplified illustration:

const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
if (err) throw err;
console.log(data);
});

console.log('Reading file...');

8. Explain the purpose of the process object in Node.js.

Answer: The process object provides information and control over the Node.js process. It includes properties like process.env for environment variables and process.argv for command-line arguments.

9. What is the difference between setTimeout and setImmediate in Node.js?

Answer: setTimeout schedules a callback to run after a specified delay, while setImmediate schedules a callback to run at the end of the current event loop iteration. setImmediate has higher priority.

setTimeout(() => {
console.log('setTimeout');
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
console.log('setImmediate');
});

Output: “setImmediate” will be logged first.

10. How can you handle errors in Node.js, and what is the purpose of the error event in streams?

Answer:
Errors in Node.js can be handled using try/catch for synchronous code and .catch() or error event listeners for asynchronous operations. The error event in streams is used to handle errors that occur during reading or writing operations in streams.
