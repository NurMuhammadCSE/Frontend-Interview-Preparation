### What are Scopes in JavaScript?

A scope is a set of variables, objects, and functions that you have access to. There are three types of scopes in JavaScript. Which are Global Scope, Function Scope (Local Scope), and Block Scope.

### What is a closure in JavaScript?

A closure is a function that has access to its outer function scope even after the outer function has returned. This means a closure can remember and access variables and arguments of its outer function even after the function has finished.

### What is Prototype Chain in JavaScript?

The prototype chain in JavaScript refers to the chain of objects linked by their prototypes. When a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript first checks the object itself. If it doesn't find it there, it looks up the property or method in the object's prototype. This process continues, moving up the chain from one prototype to the next, until the property or method is found or the end of the chain is reached (typically the prototype of the base object, which is null). The prototype chain is fundamental to JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model, allowing objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
