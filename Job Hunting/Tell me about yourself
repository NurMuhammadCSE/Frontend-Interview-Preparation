My name is Nur Muhammad, and I’m a full stack developer with a strong passion for building web applications. I am currently studying Al-Quran and Islamic Studies at Govt. Madrasah-e-Alia, Dhaka.

I’ve worked on several projects, including the development of Electronic Gadget Hub, an e-commerce platform, and a Car Wash Booking System. In these projects, I used technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express Mongoose, and MongoDB. One of my major achievements was developing a dynamic product management system with user authentication and a persistent cart.

Additionally, I have experience with Redux for state management and tools like JWT for secure authentication. I’ve also designed admin dashboards that efficiently manage products, orders, and services

My long-term career objective is to grow into a senior full stack developer role. In the next 5 years, I see myself contributing to large-scale projects, learning new technologies, and expanding my expertise to deliver scalable web applications.
